# VS2015 Dark Theme for Android Studio / IntelliJ

- [Notepad++ Version](https://github.com/Nidre/VS2015-Dark-Npp/)
- [Atom Version](https://github.com/Nidre/VS2015-Dark-Atom/)

This is as close as I can get to a replica of the Visual Studio 2015's Dark theme in Android Studio/IntelliJ.  Particularly close attention has been paid to Java, C++/C, XML and HTML.

Installation
--------------------------
1. Download settings.jar.
2. Launch Android Studio.
3. Select *File* → *Import Settings* from the main menu and select settings.jar.
4. Restart IDE when asked.
5. After the IDE restarted go to the Preferences, expand *Editor* → *Colors and fonts* tab and choose the installed theme.
